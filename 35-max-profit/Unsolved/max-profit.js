// Write a function that takes an array of integers representing the price of a stock on different days. Return the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a single stock

//! the order of the array matters, the figures represent the price corresponding to a day, therefore you can not go back in time to sell... buy one day, sell at a later day...

var maxProfit = function(prices) {



};
